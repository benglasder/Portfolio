    <h2>Free Time</h2>
    <p>In my freetime, I like to cook, listen to music, play guitar and piano, and read up on new technology.
        In the winter, I shift my focus into getting out and skiing as much as
        possible. Once snow hits, you will find me out in the mountains almost every weekend!
